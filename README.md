- the code to reproduce the image segmetnation described in the accompanying [code story](https://www.microsoft.com/developerblog/2018/01/31/deep-learning-image-segmentation-for-ecommerce-catalogue-visual-search/)

- how to train your own specific image segmentation with your own data

A trained model can be found [here](https://dwrds.blob.core.windows.net/tiramisu/TiramisuSmallModel_20180225.h5).
